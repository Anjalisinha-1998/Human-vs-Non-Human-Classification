# Human-vs-Non-Human-Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into two categories: human and non-human. The project utilizes the power of deep learning to automatically detect and classify whether an image contains a human or not.

### Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a robust image classification model capable of distinguishing between images containing humans and images containing other objects or scenes. This task has numerous applications in fields such as security, surveillance, and content moderation.

### Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

### Training
To train the model, we need to :

1.Prepare your dataset with images of humans and non-humans.
2.Split your dataset into training and validation sets.
3.Design your CNN architecture.
4.Train your model using the training set.
5.Evaluate your model using the validation set.
6.Tune hyperparameters and/or architecture to improve performance.

### Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation set.
